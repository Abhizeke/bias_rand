Synopsis

This program is to generate random number with the condition 73% of total generated should be higher side and 27% lower side of required number span e.g.
if I want a random number between 1 to 10 100times then it should give number more than 5 73times and less than 5 27times.
Every number generate has the probality of 73% to be lies between the Middle value & Higher Value.

Working

Divide single number into two parts according to percentage and add up each part separately.
Generate the random number for each part with their condition i.e. higher or lower number. 

Prerequisites

	Python 2.7

Algorithm

	PH = 0 ; PL = 0 ; RH = 0 ; LR ; UR

	MID = (UR + LR)/2
	PH = PH + 0.73
	PL = PL + 0.27

	if PH > 1:
    		RH = random.randint (MID, UR)
    		return RN
    		PH = PH - 1


	if PL > 1:
    		RH =  random.randint (LR, MID)
    		retrun RN
    		PL = PL - 1


Explanation 

Let A is a event to occur. 
Probability of getting A

	P(A) Ð„ [0,1]  

let say we have 100 value between 0 to 1  so get any single value, say x
we have the probability

	P(x) = 1/100

But in our case we need a number with 73% biased to higher limit.
Therfore we need to increase the probability of  numbers between MID to UR with 73%.

	PH = PH + 0.73
	
now, everything when PH >1 our algorithm generates a number lies between MID to UR, then deduct the 1 from PH, remaining value of PH wait till it becomes complete 1 again to regenrate the next value.

Same happen with PL where it increases with 0.27
